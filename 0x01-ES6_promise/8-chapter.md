This example demonstrates various scenarios and techniques for handling promises. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **tetheredGetNumber():** This function represents an asynchronous operation that returns a random number after a delay. If the generated number is less than a predefined threshold (`THRESHOLD_A`), the promise is resolved with the number; otherwise, it is rejected with an error message.

2. **determineParity():** This function takes a number as input and determines whether it's odd or even. It returns an object containing the original value and a boolean indicating whether it's odd.

3. **troubleWithGetNumber():** This function handles errors encountered in `tetheredGetNumber()`. It constructs and throws an error object with the message "Trouble getting number".

4. **promiseGetWord():** This function takes an object with parity information as input. If the value is below a certain threshold (`THRESHOLD_A - 1`), it adds a property `wordEvenOdd` to the object indicating whether the number is odd or even. Otherwise, it rejects the promise with an error message.

5. **Promise chain:** The promise chain begins with `new Promise(tetheredGetNumber)`, which initiates the asynchronous operation. Each `.then()` in the chain processes the result of the previous step, and the `.catch()` handles any errors that occur during the chain. Finally, `.finally()` is used to perform cleanup or logging after the promise chain completes, regardless of its outcome.

Let's examine how the promise chain works:
- If `tetheredGetNumber()` resolves successfully, `determineParity()` is called to determine the parity of the number.
- If `tetheredGetNumber()` encounters an error, `troubleWithGetNumber()` handles the error and throws a new error object.
- After determining the parity, `promiseGetWord()` is called to add a word indicating odd or even to the result.
- The final `.then()` logs the result, and the `.catch()` handles any errors that occur during the promise chain.
- The `.finally()` block is executed after the promise chain completes, whether it succeeds or fails.

By running this code, you can observe how promises handle asynchronous operations and errors in a structured and manageable way.
