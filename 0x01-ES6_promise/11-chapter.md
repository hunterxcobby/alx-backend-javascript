### Concept Explanation:
In JavaScript, a settings object provides additional context when code is running, including information about the realm (the environment in which code executes) and other environment-specific details like the origin.

#### Tracking the Incumbent Settings Object:
- The incumbent settings object is tracked to ensure that the correct settings are used for a given piece of user code.
- It helps resolve issues related to different realms having their own copies of objects like `Array` and `Error`, which can lead to unexpected behavior, especially with promises.

#### Example with iframes:
- Consider a scenario where an `<iframe>` embedded in a document communicates with its host. 
- Since web APIs are aware of the incumbent settings object, communication works smoothly across different realms.
- Example:
  ```html
  <!doctype html> <iframe></iframe>
  <!-- we have a realm here -->
  <script>
    const bound = frames[0].postMessage.bind(frames[0], "some data", "*");
    // bound is a built-in function — there is no user
    // code on the stack, so which realm do we use?
    setTimeout(bound);
    // this still works, because we use the youngest
    // realm (the incumbent) on the stack
  </script>
  ```
- Even when modifying the example to use promises, the incumbent settings object ensures proper functioning.

#### Impact on Promise Execution:
- If we modify the above example to involve promises, the incumbent settings object ensures that promises execute correctly across different realms.
- Example:
  ```html
  <!doctype html> <iframe></iframe>
  <!-- we have a realm here -->
  <script>
    const bound = frames[0].postMessage.bind(frames[0], "some data", "*");
    // bound is a built in function — there is no user
    // code on the stack — which realm do we use?
    Promise.resolve(undefined).then(bound);
    // this still works, because we use the youngest
    // realm (the incumbent) on the stack
  </script>
  ```

#### Observing the Effect:
- In an example where an `<iframe>` listens to post messages, the incumbent settings object determines whether the inner text of the `<iframe>` gets updated.
- Example:
  ```html
  <!-- y.html -->
  <!doctype html>
  <iframe src="x.html"></iframe>
  <script>
    const bound = frames[0].postMessage.bind(frames[0], "some data", "*");
    Promise.resolve(undefined).then(bound);
  </script>
  ```

### Code Example:
```html
<!-- x.html -->
<!doctype html>
<script>
  window.addEventListener(
    "message",
    (event) => {
      document.querySelector("#text").textContent = "hello";
      // this code will only run in browsers that track the incumbent settings object
      console.log(event);
    },
    false,
  );
</script>
```

This code illustrates how the incumbent settings object ensures proper execution of promises and communication between different realms, preventing issues that may arise due to differences in execution environments.
